Project: Recursion on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-recursion)

Warmup: Fibonacci
  Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. 
  Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].

  Write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively.

Project: Merge Sort
  Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
